# HDR-Release
 A simple repo to house the current release version of HDR and its addons


# Pull Requests
Feel free to create your own addons and PR them here!
If your addon gets accepted, it will be available in the HDR installer for everyone to download and use!


At the moment, however, we aren't accepting skyline plugin addons, as they may cause Undefined Behavior with HDR.
